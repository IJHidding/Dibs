Version: 1.0.0

Description: The DIBS function performs imputation benchmarking for datasets containing NA's or zeros. 
    It will introduce NA's in data where it does not yet exist, then impute those values back in using variables 
    with a high correlation to the variable to be imputed. It compares the new values with the original values,
    then it averages all those results to detect the overal best method. Depending on the mode selected, DIBS will 
    then automatically select this method and impute your imput dataset. With setting 2 or 3 it will return the input data
    frame with filled in zeros. If setting 1 is selected DIBS returns the correlation dataframe. Additionally an output pdf
    and csv file will be created. The csv contains the correlation dataframe for review and the pdf contains several plots;
    a histogram of the overall missingness; a heatmap showing correlation between random variables from the dataset, giving an
    indication if there is any correlation between the variables; density plots showing a percentage of well performing and 
    poorly performing variables in the dataset. A list of poorly performing variables used in the benchmark is added at the 
    end aswell as any variables for which not enough correlated other variables could be found.
